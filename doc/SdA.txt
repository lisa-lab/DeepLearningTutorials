The Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SdA) is an extension of the stacked 
autoencoder [Bengio07]_ and it was introduced in [Vincent08]_. 

This tutorial builds on the previous tutorial :ref:`dA` and we recommend,
especially if you do not have experience with autoencoders, to read it
before going any further.

Stacked Autoencoders
++++++++++++++++++++

The denoising autoencoders can be stacked to form a deep network by
feeding the latent representation (output code)
of the denoising auto-encoder found on the layer 
below as input to the current layer. The **unsupervised pre-training** of such an 
architecture is done one layer at a time. Each layer is trained as 
a denoising auto-encoder by minimizing the reconstruction of its input
(which is the output code of the previous layer).
Once the first :math:`k` layers 
are trained, we can train the :math:`k+1`-th layer because we can now 
compute the code or latent representation from the layer below. 
Once all layers are pre-trained, the network goes through a second stage
of training called **fine-tuning**. Here we consider **supervised fine-tuning**
where we want to minimize prediction error on a supervised task.
For this we first add a logistic regression 
layer on top of the network (more precisely on the output code of the
output layer). We then
train the entire network as we would train a multilayer 
perceptron. At this point, we only consider the encoding parts of
each auto-encoder.
This stage is supervised, since now we use the target class during
training (see the :ref:`mlp` for details on the multilayer perceptron).

This can be easily implemented in Theano, using the class defined
before for a denoising autoencoder. We can see the stacked denoising
autoencoder as having two facades, one is a list of
autoencoders, the other is an MLP. During pre-training we use the first facade, i.e we treat our model
as a list of autoencoders, and train each autoencoder seperately. In the 
second stage of training, we use the second facade. These two
facedes are linked by the fact that the autoencoders and the sigmoid layers of 
the MLP share parameters, and the fact that autoencoders get as input latent
representations of intermediate layers of the MLP.

``self.sigmoid_layers`` will store the sigmoid layers of the MLP facade, while
``self.dA_layers`` will store  the denoising autoencoder associated with the layers of the MLP. 

Next step, we construct ``n_layers`` sigmoid layers (we use the
``HiddenLayer`` class introduced in :ref:`mlp`, with the only
modification that we replaced the non-linearity from ``tanh`` to the
logistic function :math:`s(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}`) and ``n_layers``
denoising autoencoders, where ``n_layers`` is the depth of our model.
We link the sigmoid layers such that they form an MLP, and construct
each denoising autoencoder such that they share the weight matrix and the 
bias of the encoding part with its corresponding sigmoid layer.

.. code-block:: python

       for i in xrange(self.n_layers):
            # construct the sigmoidal layer

            # the size of the input is either the number of hidden units of 
            # the layer below or the input size if we are on the first layer

            else:
                input_size = hidden_layers_sizes[i - 1]

            sigmoid_layer = HiddenLayer(rng=rng,

            # add the layer to our list of layers 
            self.sigmoid_layers.append(sigmoid_layer)

            # its arguably a philosophical question...
            # but we are going to only declare that the parameters of the

            # Construct a denoising autoencoder that shared weights with this
            # layer
            dA_layer = dA(rng=rng, trng=trng, input=layer_input, 
                          n_visible=input_size,

All we need now is to add the logistic layer on top of the sigmoid
layers such that we have an MLP. We will 
use the ``LogisticRegression`` class introduced in :ref:`logreg`. 

.. code-block:: python

        # We now need to add a logistic layer on top of the MLP
        self.logLayer = LogisticRegression(
                         input=self.sigmoid_layers[-1].output,
                         n_in=hidden_layers_sizes[-1], n_out=n_outs)

        self.params.extend(self.logLayer.params)
        # construct a function that implements one step of finetunining

        # compute the cost for second phase of training, 
        # defined as the negative log likelihood 
        self.finetune_cost = self.logLayer.negative_log_likelihood(self.y)
        # compute the gradients with respect to the model parameters
        # symbolic variable that points to the number of errors made on the
        # minibatch given by self.x and self.y
        self.errors = self.logLayer.errors(self.y)


The class also provides a method that generates training functions for
each of the denoising autoencoder associated with the different layers. 
They are returned as a list, where element :math:`i` is a function that
implements one step of training the ``dA`` correspoinding to layer 
:math:`i`.

.. code-block:: python 

    def pretraining_functions(self, train_set_x, batch_size):
        ''' Generates a list of functions, each of them implementing one 
        step in trainnig the dA corresponding to the layer with same index.
        The function will require as input the minibatch index, and to train
        a dA you just need to iterate, calling the corresponding function on 
        all minibatch indexes.

        :type train_set_x: theano.tensor.TensorType
        :param train_set_x: Shared variable that contains all datapoints used
                            for training the dA

        :type batch_size: int
        :param batch_size: size of a [mini]batch

        :type learning_rate: float
        :param learning_rate: learning rate used during training for any of 
                              the dA layers
        '''

        # index to a [mini]batch
        index = T.lscalar('index')  # index to a minibatch

In order to be able to change the corruption level or the learning rate
during training we associate a Theano variable to them.

.. code-block:: python 

        corruption_level = T.scalar('corruption')  # amount of corruption to use
        learning_rate = T.scalar('lr')  # learning rate to use
        # number of batches
        n_batches = train_set_x.get_value(borrow=True).shape[0] / batch_size
        # begining of a batch, given `index`
        batch_begin = index * batch_size
        # ending of a batch given `index`
        batch_end = batch_begin + batch_size

        pretrain_fns = []
        for dA in self.dA_layers:
            # get the cost and the updates list
            cost, updates = dA.get_cost_updates(corruption_level, learning_rate)
            # compile the theano function    
            fn = theano.function(inputs=[index, 
                              theano.Param(corruption_level, default=0.2),
                              theano.Param(learning_rate, default=0.1)], 
                    outputs=cost, 
                    updates=updates,
                    givens={self.x: train_set_x[batch_begin:batch_end]})
            # append `fn` to the list of functions
            pretrain_fns.append(fn)

        return pretrain_fns
 
Now any function ``pretrain_fns[i]`` takes as arguments ``index`` and 
optionally ``corruption`` -- the corruption level or ``lr`` -- the
learning rate. Note that the name of the parameters are the name given 
to the Theano variables when they are constructed, not the name of the 
python variables (``learning_rate`` or ``corruption_level``). Keep this 
in mind when working with Theano. 

In the same fashion we build a method for constructing function required 
during finetuning ( a ``train_model``, a ``validate_model`` and a
``test_model`` function). 

.. code-block:: python

    def build_finetune_functions(self, datasets, batch_size, learning_rate):
        '''Generates a function `train` that implements one step of 
        finetuning, a function `validate` that computes the error on

        :type datasets: list of pairs of theano.tensor.TensorType
        :param datasets: It is a list that contain all the datasets;  
                         the has to contain three pairs, `train`, 
                         `valid`, `test` in this order, where each pair
                         is formed of two Theano variables, one for the 
                         datapoints, the other for the labels

        # compute number of minibatches for training, validation and testing
        n_valid_batches = valid_set_x.get_value(borrow=True).shape[0] / batch_size

        updates = []
        for param, gparam in zip(self.params, gparams):
            updates.append((param, param - gparam * learning_rate))

        train_fn = theano.function(inputs=[index], 
              outputs=self.finetune_cost,

              givens={

                self.y: train_set_y[index * batch_size: (index + 1) * batch_size]})

        test_score_i = theano.function([index], self.errors,
                 givens={
                   self.x: test_set_x[index * batch_size: (index+1) * batch_size],

        valid_score_i = theano.function([index], self.errors,
              givens={
                 self.x: valid_set_x[index * batch_size: (index + 1) * batch_size],
                 self.y: valid_set_y[index * batch_size: (index + 1) * batch_size]})

        # Create a function that scans the entire validation set
        def valid_score():
            return [valid_score_i(i) for i in xrange(n_valid_batches)]

        # Create a function that scans the entire test set
        def test_score():
            return [test_score_i(i) for i in xrange(n_test_batches)]

        return train_fn, valid_score, test_score



Note that the returned ``valid_score`` and ``test_score`` are not Theano
functions, but rather python functions that also loop over the entire 
validation set and the entire test set producing a list of the losses
over these sets.




Putting it all together
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The few lines of code below constructs the stacked denoising
autoencoder : 

.. code-block:: python 

    numpy_rng = numpy.random.RandomState(123)
    print '... building the model'
    # construct the stacked denoising autoencoder class
    sda = SdA(numpy_rng=numpy_rng, n_ins=28 * 28, 
              hidden_layers_sizes=[100, 100, 100],
              n_outs=10)
 


There are two stages in training this network, a layer-wise pre-training and 
fine-tuning afterwards. 

For the pre-training stage, we will loop over all the layers of the
network. For each layer we will use the compiled theano function that
implements a SGD step towards optimizing the weights for reducing 
the reconstruction cost of that layer. This function will be applied 
to the training set for a fixed number of epochs given by
``pretraining_epochs``.


.. code-block:: python

    #########################
    # PRETRAINING THE MODEL #
    #########################
    print '... getting the pretraining functions'
    pretraining_fns = sda.pretraining_functions(
                                        train_set_x=train_set_x,
                                        batch_size=batch_size)

    print '... pre-training the model'
    start_time = time.clock()
    ## Pre-train layer-wise
    for i in xrange(sda.n_layers):
        # go through pretraining epochs
        for epoch in xrange(pretraining_epochs):
            # go through the training set
            c = []
            for batch_index in xrange(n_train_batches):
                c.append( pretraining_fns[i](index=batch_index, 
                         corruption=0.2, lr=pretrain_lr ) )
            print 'Pre-training layer %i, epoch %d, cost '%(i,epoch), numpy.mean(c)
 
    end_time = time.clock()

    print ('Pretraining took %f minutes' %((end_time - start_time) / 60.))
 



The fine-tuning loop is very similar with the one in the :ref:`mlp`, the
only difference is that we will use now the functions given by
``build_finetune_functions``  .




Running the Code
++++++++++++++++

The user can run the code by calling:

.. code-block:: bash
  
  python code/SdA.py

By default the code runs 15 pre-training epochs for each layer, with a batch
size of 1. The  corruption level for the first layer is 0.1, for the second
0.2 and 0.3 for the third. The pretraining learning rate is was 0.001 and 
the finetuning learning rate is 0.1. Pre-training takes 585.01 minutes, with 
an average of 13 minutes per epoch. Fine-tuning is completed after 36 epochs
in 444.2 minutes, with an average of 12.34 minutes per epoch. The final 
validation score is 1.39% with a testing score of 1.3%. 
These results were obtained on a machine with an Intel
Xeon E5430 @ 2.66GHz CPU, with a single-threaded GotoBLAS.


Tips and Tricks
+++++++++++++++

One way to improve the running time of your code (given that you have
sufficient memory available), is to compute how the network, up to layer
:math:`k-1`, transforms your data. Namely, you start by training your first
layer dA. Once it is trained, you can compute the hidden units values for
every datapoint in your dataset and store this as a new dataset that you will
use to train the dA corresponding to layer 2. Once you trained the dA for
layer 2, you compute, in a similar fashion, the dataset for layer 3 and so on.
You can see now, that at this point, the dAs are trained individually, and
they just provide (one to the other) a non-linear transformation of the input.
Once all dAs are trained, you can start fine-tunning the model.
